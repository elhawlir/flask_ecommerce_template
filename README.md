## Purpose
After not knowing how to get started in web development with Python (that's the language I knew), I've experimented for the past 18 months with a number of different frameworks.

Streamlit, Flask and Django but Flask was the most beginner friendly of the robust frameworks. Streamlit is getting there but still a bit niche (data/ML apps).

This template provides a full scale web app with payments integration, User authentication, cloud-native development set up and other random functionalities you can choose to exclude if you so wish.
